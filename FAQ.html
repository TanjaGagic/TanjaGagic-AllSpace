    <div class = "pitanje">

        <p class = "q">1. Do I have to be really fit to go into space?</h3><br> </p>
            <p class="odgovor"> The fitness standards for space tourists, especially for sub-orbital spaceflights, are much less than for government astronauts. You donâ€™t have to be Superman <br>or Wonderwoman. 
            However, there will be some medical 
            screening to ensure that all selected tourists will be able to enjoy their experience. </p>
    
        <p class = "q">2. How do you eat/drink/go to the bathroom when in space?</h3><br></p>
         <p class="odgovor"> It will all be covered in your training course, do not worry about it- you won't stay hungry!
        </p>
            
        <p class = "q">3. Are there any age restrictions?</h3><br></p>
            <p class="odgovor"> To participate in one of our challenges you need to be 18 years old or older. If you are under 18, you may still be able to participate but subject to being accompanied <br>
            by a parent or guardian or a responsible adult. 
        </p>
                  
        <p class = "q">4. What do I need to pack?</h3><br></p>
            <p class="odgovor"> At the time of booking you will be provided with a trip dossier which includes a suggested packing list plus lots of information about the tour and what to expect. <br>
            Please read this carefully because this is packed full of useful information to prepare you for your trip.
        </p>
                        
        <p class = "q">5. Do I have to have travel insurance to travel on one of your tours?</h3><br></p>
             <p class="odgovor">Yes. travel insurance is mandatory on our challenges due to the nature of the tour. We require all your insurance details at least 12 weeks prior to departure but <br>
            you are strongly recommended to purchase travel insurance before or at the time of booking to protect your non-refundable registration fee.
        </p>
                                  
        <p class = "q">6. What if I have existing travel insurance policy cover?</h3><br> </p><p class="odgovor">If you have existing insurance, we require you to inform your insurance company of the type of <br>
            activities you will be involved with, as your policy may not cover these activities.
        </p>
                        
        <p class = "q" > 7. What if I do not have a credit card?</h3><br></p>
            <p class="odgovor"> Contact us via email and you will be advised on other payment options.</p>
                                
        <p class = "q">8. What to do when encountering alien species?</h3><br></p>
            <p class="odgovor"> First of all- do not panic! Second of all- take a selfie with them, post it on instagram and tag AllPeace to win a chance for your next free trip into space with us!
        </p>
                                   
        <p class = "q">9. Can I bring my pet with me? </h3><br></p>
            <p class="odgovor"> Of course you can! ( If your pet is smaller than 3kg and you pay a ticket for it. Pet ticket costs only 1000$!!! )
        </p>
